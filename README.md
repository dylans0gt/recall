The game "Recall" challenges the user's memory 
skills by presenting a series of random numbers on the screen for a few 
seconds. The player's task is to remember as many of these 
numbers as 
possible within the time limit. Once the time is up, the numbers disappear 
and the player must then enter the numbers they remember in the correct 
order.

As the user's score increases in each level, so does the number of digits 
they need to remember.

"Recall" is a great offline CLI game for anyone who wants to improve their 
memory skills, and it's perfect for players of all ages.

In your terminal, run the following commands:

apt-get install python3

apt-get install git

git clone https://github.com/dylans0gt/recall.git

cd recall

pip install -r requirements.txt

** THE GAME STARTS AS SOON AS YOU RUN THIS COMMAND **
python3 recall.py

Have fun!
